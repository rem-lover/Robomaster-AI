1. 	Install cuda 12.1 (not the newest version as pytorch doesn't support it) and cudnn for gpu accel
2. 	Install newest python
3. 	Install ultralytics module
4. 	Refer to "https://docs.ultralytics.com/"
5. 	Install pytorch nightly
6. 	Modify the settings as needed
7. 	Download an annotated dataset from DJI hub
8. 	Write a converter script to convert the dataset from DJI format to yolov8 format
9. 	Train a pretrained model with the dataset
		Remember to use gpu, cpu runs very slow (from 80x to 135x slower)
		So definitly use gpu to train
		For reference, around 4it/s on RTX3060 
10. Look at the results and repeat the training with "best.pt"
11.	Write a training script and train until it overfits
		Brief explanation of overfit:
		When the training loss continues to decrease but validation loss increases, overfit occurs
12. Write a predicting script and use the "best.pt" to predict on a new video
13. Convert the results back to DJI format and import it
14. You definitly have to check every frame by hand before using it, don't be lazy
		As the saying goes,'Garbage in, Garbage out'
		The dji model will not perform well if you give it sh!t data
		So remeber to check every single frame and every single label of the output berfore using it

That's it if you only want to use yolov8 to generate more datasets for robomaster
For other applications, use google and learn it yourself, the ability to google and self-learn is very important :)
So if you encounter any problems when writing the various python scripts, try to solve it yourself
Try not to come cry to me immediately,  but I welcome any questions nonetheless
